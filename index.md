The Lind lab studies microbes that live in the animal gut, focusing on single-celled protists and how they interact with the host. We use computational genomics approaches along with wet-lab microbiology to understand the evolution and ecology of intestinal protists.

We are located in the Krone Enginereed Biosciences Building.
